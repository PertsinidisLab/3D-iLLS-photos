3D Interferometric Lattice Light-Sheet Imaging setup Photographs
Show here are photographs of the current 3D Interferometric Lattice Light-Sheet Imaging setup

The excitation path is built based on the originally reported LLS design.


1. Laser combiner, Lattice light sheet generation
An ATOF device (AA OPTO-ELECTRONIC, ATFnC-400.650-TN and MPDS8C driver) facilitates on-off switching of a CW laser beam (642nm; MPB Communications, 2RU-VFL-P-500-642-B1R or 2RU-VFL-P-2000-642-B1R) and modulating laser power.

2. Telescope expansion, Lattice light sheet generation
An elliptical lens telescope reshapes the excitation beams

8. Florescent path (Top)
Shown is the fluorescent path on the top objective. The mirrors are located atop of a motor, used to find the zero-path length.
